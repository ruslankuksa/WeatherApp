# WeatherApp
Simple weather app for iOS

Hi there. It's my first serious project for iOS and it's also my first experience with git, so you can see that some commits
don't have any sense(really sorry about that and for my grammatical errors :) ). 

This app using https://www.worldweatheronline.com API. 
For run this app, create a Keys.plist in project folder and put you API key there.
